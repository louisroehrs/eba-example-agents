## EBA Components

This document covers each of the core components that constitute a skill. It is important to note that EBA follows an ontology based paradigm, meaning that it derives understanding about the world based on a relationship of concepts. This is in contrast to most other systems which are intent based and depend on predicate logic.

At a high level, EBA is composed of an [ontology](./Ontology.md) of concepts and [attributes](./Attributes.md) that it is able to recognize and reason about. Natural language [patterns](Patterns.md) help the assistant to perform natural language understanding, linking language tokens to appropriate concepts. In the process of reasoning about a question, the system considers all possible outcomes it can take given a set of [actions](./Actions.md) and [rules](./Rules.md), ultimately selecting the best one or asking for user disambiguation in cases where it is fitting. You can learn more about each of these components as well as a few of our [core concepts](./CoreConcepts.md).
