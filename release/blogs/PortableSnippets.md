## Portable snippets

As an assistant, EBA is designed to assist with your daily business workflows. A key aspect of any business workflow is the ability share data insights. EBA portable snippets is a feature associated with your assistant's responses designed to make data easily shareable with your colleagues. Snippets can be created by clicking the chain-link icon which appears next to your data on mouse hover. Clicking on this link will create a portable snippet with live data which can be sent by email, embedded into a presentation or a website. You can share an anomaly you just discovered or a report you just created. Data will be shared within a trusted ring of identity providers according to your settings. For IBM such ring includes IBMid, Common UI Shell and former Watson Workspace. As shown below, when creating snippets, there is a space to enter the list of users within your trusted identity with which to share your data. Changes to this field will update the settings associated with the snippet.
