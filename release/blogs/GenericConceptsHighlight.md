## Generic concepts highlighting

The EBA team has released a safe-guard feature within the NL patterns editor--highlighting of generic concepts. Concepts without a namespace, e.g. `:ActionShow`, will be highlighted with a red color within the editor. Although we encourage users to extend core functionality when appropriate, it is also possible to introduce unwanted interference to existing functionality if developers are not careful in their NLU training. A warning message is posted to users in such cases as a word of caution.
