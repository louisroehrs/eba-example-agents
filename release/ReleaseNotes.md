We push releases every Thursday evening PST. All new features and enhancements are made available immediately to developers.

## Release Notes

We love to release new features both for our reasoning core as well as our development lab. This page serves as a catalog for each new feature. Since each feature deserves attention in its own right, we have provided a table of contents below which links to a detailed page where you can find descriptions, examples, and use case scenarios. Note that a few features may be currently marked as preview only. To preview such features, simply add 'preview' as a query string to our url--[like so](https://eba.ibm.com/assistant?preview).
